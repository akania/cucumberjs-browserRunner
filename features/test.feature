Feature: Simple maths
  In order to do maths
  As a developer
  I want to increment variables

  Scenario: easy maths
    Given a variable set to 1
    When I increment the variable by 1
    Then the variable should contain 2

  Scenario: much more complex stuff
    Given a variable set to 100
    When I increment the variable by 6
    Then the variable should contain 106
